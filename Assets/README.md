N/A (Individual Side Quest)

## Description

This project is a small p5.js platformer that redesigns a soft blob character’s movement and environment to express the emotion **frustration**.  
The blob feels intentionally sluggish and unresponsive, with sticky movement, delayed input, and subtle environmental interference. Platforms and visual feedback work together to create a sense of resistance, making the experience playable but deliberately irritating.

---

## Interaction Instructions

- Use **A / D** or **← / →** to move left and right
- Press **Space**, **W**, or **↑** to jump (only when grounded)
- Land on platforms to move through the environment

The blob’s delayed response, heavy movement, and visual shake feedback are intentional and reflect the frustration theme.

## Assets
