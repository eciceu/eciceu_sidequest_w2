## Description

This project is an interactive p5.js sketch that explores how emotion can be communicated through movement and interaction. The player controls a soft, blob-like character navigating a simple platform environment. Instead of focusing on complex mechanics or visuals, the project emphasizes how movement, physics, and responsiveness can express a sense of anxiety or tension.

The blob’s motion, including its wobble, acceleration, friction, and jump behaviour, was intentionally tuned to feel slightly unstable and reactive. The design is inspired by the idea that emotional states can be felt through how an object moves in space rather than through explicit explanation or text.
